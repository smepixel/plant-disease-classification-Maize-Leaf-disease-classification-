# 🌿 Machine Learning Classification Technique for Plant Disease Detection

## 📘 Overview
This project applies **machine learning and image classification** to identify plant diseases from leaf images. The goal is to help farmers and researchers detect diseases early and reduce crop loss.

## 🧠 Key Features
- Built a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model for plant disease classification.
- Preprocessed image data using **OpenCV** and **TensorFlow**.
- Trained and tested models to achieve high accuracy in disease prediction.
- Created an accessible, user-friendly approach for agricultural monitoring.

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 Results
- Achieved >90% classification accuracy (based on dataset quality).
- Demonstrated potential to improve early disease detection and yield optimization.
